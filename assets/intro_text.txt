Japan, 1467.

Your forces are on the brink of defeat. Desperation drives you to unsheathe an ancient relic. With a swift slash, you cut it open.

The relic releases ancient spirits, possesing foe and ally alike.

It also throws you into a familiar land in a distant future, where the possesed soldiers still roam.

You failed Japan and condemned the world.

As the last shogun, your final duty is clear: grant them an honorable death.

This is your last stand.
