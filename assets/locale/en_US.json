With a swift slash, you cut it open.\n\nThe relic releases ancient spirits, possesing foe and ally alike.\n\nIt also throws you into a familiar land in a distant future, where the possesed soldiers still roam.\n\nYou failed Japan and condemned the world.\n\nAs the last shogun, your final duty is clear: grant them an honorable death.\n\nThis is your last stand.",
